# Algorithm Exploration - Cubing Workflow

## Type of cube
The type of cube I will be using and learning to solve is the Pyraminx.

## Current Skills 
* I am able to sometimes solve a Pyraminx with the help of a YouTube video
* I do not currently know how to solve it on my own, and I have yet to memorize the algorithm

## Method 
The method I would like to use is the one seen in the YouTube video below:

*It is also known as the layer by layer method*  

## Goals
My current goals are  
* Understand the different parts of the Pyraminx, and what conditions need to be met for my method to be effective (ex. Identify center vs edge piece)
* Learn and figure out the algorithms in a way that I could solve on my own
* Have a lower solve time by the end of this project
* Be able to solve the Pyraminx by myself

# Records of Solve Times
| Date and Time    | AO5   | AO12  | AO25  |
| -----------------|-------|-------|-------| 
| 12/12/20 13:30   |11:29.3|11:20.2| \\\\  |
| 14/12/20 16:00   |11:17.2|11.19.6| \\\\  |
| 15/12/20 16:00   |10:56.7|10:54.9| \\\\  |
| 16/12/20 19:00   |10:55.8|11:09.4| \\\\  |
| 17/12/20 17:00   |10:53.5|10:51.2| \\\\  |  

*I did not have time to solve for AO25, but a new goal of mine will be to get it low enough to do that*  
*I plan to use [this site](https://cubingtime.com/) to time my solves.*
