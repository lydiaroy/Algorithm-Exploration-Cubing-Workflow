# Algorithm Exploration - Cubing Workflow

## Type of cube
The type of cube I will be using and learning to solve is the Pyraminx.

## Current Skills 
* I am able to sometimes solve a Pyraminx with the help of a YouTube video
* I do not currently know how to solve it on my own, and I have yet to memorize the algorithm

## Method 
The method I would like to use is the one seen in the YouTube video below:

*It is also known as the layer by layer method*  

## Goals
My current goals are  
* Understand the different parts of the Pyraminx, and what conditions need to be met for my method to be effective (ex. Identify center vs edge piece)
* Learn and figure out the algorithms in a way that I could solve on my own
* Have a lower solve time by the end of this project
* Be able to solve the Pyraminx by myself

*I plan to use [this site](https://cubingtime.com/) to time my solves.*
