# Algorithm Exploration - Cubing Workflow

## Type of cube
The type of cube I will be using and learning to solve is the Pyraminx.

## Current Skills 
* I am able to sometimes solve a Pyraminx with the help of a YouTube video
* I do not currently know how to solve it on my own, and I have yet to memorize the algorithm

## Method 
The method I would like to use is the one seen in the YouTube video below:

*It is also known as the layer by layer method*  

## Goals
My current goals are  
* Understand the different parts of the Pyraminx, and what conditions need to be met for my method to be effective (ex. Identify center vs edge piece)
* Learn and figure out the algorithms in a way that I could solve on my own
* Have a lower solve time by the end of this project
* Be able to solve the Pyraminx by myself

# Records of Solve Times
| Date and Time    | AO5   | AO12  | AO25  |
| -----------------|-------|-------|-------| 
| 12/12/20 13:30   |11:29.3|11:20.2|11:25.6|
| 14/12/20 16:00   |11:17.2|11.19.6| \\\\  |
| 15/12/20 16:00   |10:56.7|10:54.9| \\\\  |
| 16/12/20 19:00   |10:55.8|11:09.4| \\\\  |
| 17/12/20 17:00   |10:53.5|10:51.2| \\\\  |  

*I did not have time to solve for AO25 most days, but a new goal of mine will be to get it low enough to do that*  
*I plan to use [this site](https://cubingtime.com/) to time my solves.*  

## Some Things I Learnt  
I learnt that solving a Pyraminx is a lot harder than it seems. I often lost focus, or found myself unable to continue more than an Average of 12. I do believe that I require a lot more practice, and hopefully I would be able to get it to 10 minutes or below. I also need to do more reasearch, as I got confused when watching videos, or had to scrap entire runs because I needed to give my mind a rest. I was, however, able to understand the algorithms, I just have trouble knowing when to apply them. I found it helpful to make drawings or write them down so I would know when to use them. Finally, I do believe this is something that could be used to further understand algorithms as a whole, and this project was a very interesting one to complete.

## Final Notes  
* I found I often got worse the more I went in one session, I think this is because I had a tendancy to get frustrated with myself/the Pyraminx
* I did not improve much over the week, I think this is due to, again, frustration and the fact that I need more time to practice
* More practice is required, but I did understand more as I practiced
